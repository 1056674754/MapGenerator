## About The Project

![Map Generator Screen Shot](https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvNjE3OTM5LzMyODY2NDUucG5n/794x1000/TWQydp.png)

This tool procedurally generates images of city maps. The process can be automated, or controlled at each stage give you finer control over the output. Generated cities can be downloaded as a `.png` or an `.svg`. There are a few choices for drawing style, ranging from colour themes similar to Google or Apple maps, to a hand-drawn sketch.


### Built With

* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)


## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these steps.

### Prerequisites


* npm
```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```

* Gulp
```
npm install --global gulp-cli
```

### Installation
 
1. Clone the mapgenerator
```sh
git clone https://github.com/probabletrain/mapgenerator.git
```
2. Install NPM packages
```sh
cd mapgenerator
npm install
```
3. Add this line to `node_modules/@svgdotjs/svg.js/package.json`
```
"browserify": {
  "transform": [["babelify", { "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"] }]]
},
```
4. Build with Gulp. This will watch for changes to any Typescript files. If you edit the HTML or CSS you will have to rerun this command. [Gulp Notify](https://github.com/mikaelbr/gulp-notify) sends a notification whenever a build finishes.
```
gulp
```
5. Open `dist/index.html` in a web browser, refresh the page whenever the project is rebuilt.
